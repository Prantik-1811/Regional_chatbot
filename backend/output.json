Phishers aim at inducing you to visit malicious websites or to reveal your sensitive information for malicious purposes. To better protect your identity, properties, reputation and computer systems, read on! What is phishing? Common types of phishing Risks and impacts How to detect? Spot Phishing Emails How to avoid? What to do? Videos Extended readings What is phishing? Phishing is the attempt mainly to obtain sensitive information from Internet users by disguising as known individuals or trustworthy institutions such as banks, schools or working partners. In some cases, phishing attacks may infect and compromise computer devices with malware. Phishing attacks are typically delivered by emails, instant messaging, forged websites or social media. Phishers may attack any time and they often carry out massive phishing campaigns during holidays or in the events of natural disasters, epidemics and major political elections, etc. Internet users should stay vigilant at all times. Common types of phishing Deceptive phishing - Phishers craft messages that look almost identical to those of legitimate institutions or individuals and conduct mass mailings so that recipients might be tricked to give out their sensitive and important personal information. Spear phishing - Spear phishing is a more sophisticated version of deceptive phishing. It targets specific individuals or companies. Phishers make use of personal information available from different sources such as social media to craft personalised messages and send them to a selected group or individual, such as senior executives and top management personnel. With a smaller target size, it is easier to include personal information such as the target’s name or job title, making the message seemingly more trustworthy and difficult to be detected. Risks and impacts Risks: Leakage of sensitive information - Phishers will disguise themselves as known individuals of victims (e.g. victims’ senior management or customers) or trustworthy institutions (e.g. banks) to lure victims to give out their sensitive information such as account names, passwords and identity information. Phishers may further use these sensitive information for malicious purpose or sell them to third parties. Malware infection - Links or attachments in phishing emails or phishing websites may contain different malware (e.g. key-logger, ransomware and cryptocurrency mining malware). If users click these links or open these attachments, their devices may get infected by the malware, which may lead to data leakage, data loss or other financial loss. Impacts: Financial loss - With sensitive information obtained from victims, phishers can carry out transactions such as transferring victims’ money to their pockets. Business operations can be disrupted due to the waste of employees’ productivity on handling consequences brought by phishing such as leakage of login account and password. Reputational loss - Phishers can further make use of information obtained from victims to send blackmail, intimidate victims’ contacts or even perform illegal activities (e.g. hacking into the system of the victim’s organisation to steal confidential information), causing the victims to be blamed or even get into legal and liability problems. As for an organisation being attacked, it may suffer reputation damage to its brand, and its customers may move their business elsewhere due to losing trust in the organisation in safeguarding their data. Intellectual property theft - Intellectual property, including trademarks, patents, trade secrets, etc. is crucial for the success of a company. With the information obtained from victims, phishing attacks can lead to theft of intellectual property which can represent millions or even billions of research and development costs, and may even threaten the future of the company. How to detect? Phishing emails: Phishing emails are crafted like emails sent from legitimate individuals or organisations. They usually contain threats (e.g. suspicious account activities that require immediate actions) or too good to be true offers (e.g. free smartphones). You should stay vigilant when such messages appear in your mailbox. Common characteristics of phishing emails: Phishing websites: Phishing websites are usually reached through links from phishing emails, social media or by clicking a suspicious advertisement. The phishing websites usually involve an account login page or a payment page which asks for your sensitive information. Therefore, you should always stay vigilant when visiting such pages. Common characteristics of phishing websites: Forged URLs – Phishing websites often have URLs that are very similar to those of a known organisation, e.g. www.famousorganisation.com vs www.famous-organisation.com. Address begins with HTTP – You should only submit your sensitive information through a HTTPS website, instead of a HTTP website. Low quality – Phishing websites are often created rashly with a short life cycle, thus grammatical/spelling mistakes and low resolution images are sometimes observed. Ask for personal information – Phishing websites are created to lure you into giving out your personal information or credentials. Example of a phishing website: Spot Phishing Emails Phishing emails can bring about serious security risks. They will steal your personal information and also infect your computers. Phishing attacks affect not only your computer but may also use your computer to compromise other computer systems of your organisation. Take Challenges Now (The challenges include four sample emails. Please try to identify these emails as “Genuine” or “Phishing”.) How to avoid? Internet users: While using email services Always stay vigilant to suspicious emails. Do not open any suspicious emails. Always check email attachments’ extension – Open email attachments with extreme care. Never open an attachment with “pif”, “exe”, “bat”, “cmd”, “vbs” extension. Always stay vigilant when giving out sensitive personal or account information – Banks and financial institutions seldom ask for your personal or account information through emails. Check with the relevant organisations in case of doubt. While browsing the Internet Avoid following links - Never follow URL links from un-trusted sources, emails or social media. Do not rely on search engine results without verifying the validity of websites of banking or financial institutions. Type URLs manually or use bookmarks for frequently visited websites or financial institution websites. Do not visit suspicious websites. Avoid conducting online banking using public WiFi connections, public terminals or insecure terminals such as those in cafés or libraries. While using social media platforms Do not accept friend-making requests from people you do not know - Once someone becomes your friend on the social media, he can access your information such as your profile, photos and social activities records. Such information may be used for illegal purposes such as spear phishing. Limit the amount of personal information available in your profile – Avoid including sensitive information such as your home address in your profile. Always remember the more information you include in your profile, the higher are the risks of leaking such information to strangers. Carefully configure your privacy settings – Decide very carefully what information you wish to make public or what to keep to your friends only. Other security considerations Update security patches and virus signatures - Always ensure that the security patches and virus signatures on your computer are up-to-date. Deploy spam filter software – Consider using desktop spam-filtering products and browser’s built-in functions to help detect and block fraudulent emails but beware of false alarms. For organisations: Inform users of the preventive measures implemented by your organisation – For example, your organisation will not ask for users’ personal or account information through email or by phone. Keep your website certificates up-to-date - Users can be assured the legitimacy of the websites. Provide channels for users to verify and report any suspicious emails/websites. Register similar domain names - Consider registering domain names that are similar to the one that is currently used by your organisation. For example, in addition to the original domain name “www.aaaabank.com.hk”, domain names “www.aaaabank.com”, “www.aaaabank.hk” can also be registered. Strengthen the security controls of your organisation’s websites, applications and email systems – Consider deploying technological solutions such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), two-factor authentication, digital certificates, firewalls and anti-malware solutions. You may also consider implementing email authentication protocols such as Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM). The SPF can help ensure that the email is sent by the sender it claims while DKIM can help verify that the content of the email is not tampered. Strengthen your operational controls - For financial institutions, implement policies such as setting limits on users’ maximum daily transaction amount, requesting pre-registration of users for using certain online transaction services. Educate users - Develop a set of best practices for users to follow when using Internet services. Conduct anti-phishing training/simulation tests regularly. What to do? When you receive suspicious email messages: Do not click on any links or download any attachments The links might lead you to malicious websites while the attachments might contain malware. Do not reply to the email Report to appropriate parties such as your organisation’s network administrator promptly for checking and cleansing. Check the true destination of links Hover over the link to check the destination address and scan the link with a link scanner such as Norton SafeWeb, URLVoid, VirusTotal. Verify the sender Verify the sender through channels other than those stated in the email, e.g. phone numbers found on your credit card or statement. Delete the suspicious messages Delete the message if you are confident enough that it is spam. Report to appropriate parties Report to appropriate parties, e.g. your bank. You should also consider reporting the attack to the Hong Kong Police Force if necessary. When you click on a link or download attachments in a suspicious email: Disconnect your device from the network This can reduce the risk of spreading malware to other devices on your network and prevent malware from sending sensitive information from your device. Report immediately Report to appropriate parties such as your organisation’s network administrator promptly for checking and cleansing. Perform a malware scan Before reconnecting your device to the network, run a complete scan with your anti-malware software. Follow the instructions given by the software to remove any suspicious files found. Change your credentials Malware may have already harvested your credentials for online accounts such as email, online banking and social media. Thus, you should change your online credentials immediately to stop phishers from using your accounts. When you have provided sensitive information to phishing emails/websites: Change your credentials Change your passwords for the related accounts. Report immediately Report to appropriate parties, e.g. your bank, your organisation’s network administrators. You should also consider reporting the attack to the Hong Kong Police Force. When my organisation’s identity is being used in a phishing attack: Alert users Issue prompt alerts to users, related parties or even the public through press release, website or emails about the fraudulent website and warn them not to respond to the suspicious or phishing emails. Report immediately Report to the police and relevant organisations / regulatory bodies such as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority about the suspicious website. Advise potential defrauded users Advise users, who are suspected to be defrauded, to change their passwords immediately and report to the police if necessary. Alert your website administrators Issue alerts to staff, administrators or service providers of your organisation’s website to strengthen security measures and to watch out for any suspicious activities such as suspicious port scanning activities, abnormally high traffic volume from certain computer devices or connection to suspicious servers in the Internet.

Potential Risks With the rising popularity of VC, there are more cyber attacks targeting VC solutions and users. It is therefore crucial to assess the risks before conducting VC meetings and ensure they are held in a secure manner. Below are some potential risks: Meeting bombing – an uninvited guest may join a VC meeting by discovering or guessing the meeting ID to disrupt the meeting or share inappropriate content. Malicious links or phishing attacks – if attackers gain access to the meeting room, they may trick participants to click malicious links. There may also be phishing emails or websites mimicking VC invitations with a malicious intent to steal user credentials or send malware. Sharing data with third parties – be aware of data sharing with third parties by the VC solution or platform and their data usage policy. Malware or zero-day attacks – there may be vulnerabilities in the VC solution that could be exploited by attackers. Security Measures The followings are some security measures / good practices to reduce the risks and avoid privacy breaches when hosting VC meetings or using VC solutions: General Security Measures Check carefully the data privacy policy of the VC application or service provider to understand how your personal data are stored, shared and used by them. Pay attention to any security news of the VC solution and take timely security measures accordingly. End-to-end encryption and network security measures should be in place to protect the transmission of sensitive data during VC meetings. Apply the latest updates and security patches to all relevant hardware / software items involved in VC, including the VC application, operating systems, web browsers and anti-malware software. Meeting Hosts Only share the meeting ID with intended participants and use one-time meeting ID where possible. Set a strong meeting password to prevent unintended third parties from joining the meeting. Limit the collection of personal data from participants to reduce leakage risks. Adopt two-factor authentication with strong unique passwords to protect the account of the meeting hosts. Use available security features to control meeting registration or sign-in, e.g. pre-registration or waiting room features. Track and verify who are at the meeting and confirm the identity of all participants. Do not allow participants to share screen by default. Only allow specific participant to do so where appropriate and only share the application needed rather than the whole desktop. Meeting Participants If a link is received to join a VC meeting, make sure the link comes from a trusted source and do not open links and attachments from unknown senders. Avoid sharing or discussing sensitive information in VC meetings conducted over public cloud or untrusted network. Avoid performing sensitive operations, such as checking emails, during the VC meeting to avoid sharing the screen with others accidentally. File transfer should be limited or disabled unless necessary to avoid malicious files being shared, and do not open any suspicious links or files shared by unknown participants. Avoid recording the VC meeting involving sensitive information since the recording may reside in public cloud of the VC service provider. VC meetings should be conducted at designated private places of individuals and any visible sensitive information should be removed from the camera view. Cameras and microphones should be turned off when not in use during the VC meeting.

Data breaches could result from cyber attacks to computer systems, networks or cloud storage during which cyber criminals gain unauthorised access to sensitive data such as personal data and financial data. Besides outsiders, data breaches could be caused by vicious insiders (e.g. privilege abuse), human errors (e.g. security misconfiguration) and negligence of users (e.g. loss of USB drive). Typically, cyber criminals will target personal data such as name, identity card number, email address, username, password, credit card number or any data that can be used for criminal or dishonest purposes (e.g. deception). For businesses, valuable data such as financial record, intellectual property, trade secret and customer data can be targeted by cyber criminals for financial gain. Causes and Impacts Common causes of data breaches: Possible Impacts of data breaches: For organisations : Reputational damage – clients and business partners may lose their trust and cast doubt on the organisation. Penalty and legal liability – the organisation may be subject to fines by regulators and lawsuits by data subjects. Disruption to business and financial losses – it may be costly and time-consuming to recover operations resulting in disruption to business and financial loss. For end users : Financial loss – personal data may be used in financial frauds (e.g. taking over the victim's account for making unauthorised transactions). Impersonation – stolen personal data may be used to gain access to a system or network in order to commit fraud, industrial espionage or identity theft. Emotional distress – individuals may become worried about the adverse consequences of data breaches, for example, the personal data may be used to humiliate the victim and cause emotional distress (e.g. celebrity photo breach). Preventive Measures Keep electronic devices in safe custody and encrypt any sensitive data stored. Use up-to-date firewall, anti-malware and anti-phishing software. Patch and update systems and applications regularly. Configure systems and devices to allow only authorised user(s) to access the sensitive data. Avoid transfer sensitive data to portable devices or any unknown third parties. Use strong password and multi-factor authentication if applicable. Be mindful of solicitations for sensitive data in suspicious emails and websites. Use secure cloud storage or services with proper security configurations and end-to-end encryption. Erase all sensitive data in storage devices thoroughly before repairing or disposing or the devices. Do not use untrusted communication channels (e.g. public Wi-Fi) or devices to conduct sensitive transactions (e.g. on-line banking) or access sensitive data. Use the Data Security Scanner provided by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, Hong Kong to conduct a quick and easy self-assessment on the sufficiency of data security measures for information and communications technology systems. Detection Signs indicating that you may have fallen victim to data breach: Receive suspicious calls or transaction records with your personal data exposed. Receive data breach notifications from a data user holding your personal data. Detect email accounts being compromised or involved in data breach incidents based on some reference sources such as \" Have I Been Pwned \". Detect suspicious activities in your accounts. Mitigation You may consider taking the following measures: Contact the respective service providers of your compromised accounts and check for any suspicious transactions. Reset the password of any of your online accounts suspected to have been compromised. Stay vigilant against phishing emails or other attempted scams using the breached data. Report the case to the Police (if any criminal activity is involved) and lodge a complaint with the PCPD (if personal privacy is infringed). Seek advice from the Hong Kong Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Centre on incident response and recovery, if necessary. For organisations, develop a response plan for handling data breach incidents and notification arrangements for issuing data breach notifications to the affected users timely. Take appropriate actions to remove the breached data from public access (e.g. submit requests to the administrator of the websites and forums concerned).
